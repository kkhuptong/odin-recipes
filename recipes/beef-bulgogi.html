    <h1>Beef Bulgogi</h1>

    <p>
        <em>
            Bulgogi, sometimes known as Korean BBQ beef, is a dish of thinly sliced grilled 
            steak that has been marinated in a sweet soy, sesame, and garlic sauce. If you want 
            to spice it up, serve the beef in lettuce cups with rice and hot pepper paste (gochujang).
            This restaurant-worthy beef bulgogi recipe is easy to make and impossible to resist. 
            A sweet and savory marinade, made with ingredients you probably already have on hand, 
            ensures melt-in-your-mouth bulgogi every time.
